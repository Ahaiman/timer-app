Timer App
===================

Hey!
I have been passionate about Web Development for a while now, so I decided to study this subject, and specialize in it.
The following project is one of my first steps in practicing React.

--------
Description
-------------
This app is a countdown seconds timer.

Technology Wise
-------------
This mini-project was created purely on client-site, using `React`. The components are based on `functional components` only. 

> - React hooks
> - ES6 logic
> - Material-UI


How Does It Work?
-------------
![See how it looks like](images/main.png)

Enter the number of seconds for performing the countdown.
You are able to **Pause**, **Start** (from the pause point), and **Reset** (setting to intial time you chose).


> **Note:** The countdown stops at 0.  You can run it again with the same input by pressing the "Reset" button.

Prerequisites
--------------------
Packages: 

* `react`
* `react-dom`
* `randomcolor`
